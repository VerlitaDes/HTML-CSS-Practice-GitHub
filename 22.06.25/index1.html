    <p>Although I had some prior experience with HTML and CSS, it was quite a while ago. As time passes, technologies evolve, and so does the need to revisit and reinforce foundational knowledge. I strongly believe that it's never too late to refresh your skills — especially when you have the opportunity not only to update what you once knew, but also to expand and deepen that understanding in new ways.</p>
    <p>My goal is to become confident and fluent in both frontend and backend development. I want to be able to build modern, functional, and visually appealing web applications from scratch and understand the full development process. This course is an exciting and important step toward that future.</p>
    <p>Despite the current challenges and heavy workload at my university, I’ve made the decision to dedicate my free time to this course. I am genuinely excited to dive into every lesson and practice consistently. Learning to code and mastering web development is not just a technical goal for me — it's a long-term investment in the career I dream of. I'm grateful for this opportunity and motivated to make the most of it.</p>
